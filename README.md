# FirstPortfolio

FIrstly, I worked on the header element wanting to create text on either side with the links for the buttons to work

Next I imported all the neccesary photos to roughly where they were supposed to be (i struggled massively with this so more work on flexbox and flex grid is needed in my week off work next week)
Next up was creating the footer for the website with the neccessary dummy information as this is not the final product.
for implementation of the about me section is where i really struggled as i couldnt quite figure out how to position the headers and text box so more work on this is a must next week.
constantly pushing things to the github repo is important as  i can keep track of the progress easily.
Overall, I am disappointed with the first draft of my portfolio, as a result i deployed it using a default github adress as opposed too the domain i purchased However i am going to re do the portfolio over the weekend too see great improvement.
Overall, a lot more work on flexox fundamentals is needed before  i redo
